## Google Homepage

This project is to simulate a google homepage with CSS/HTML following an Odin Project tutorial.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

#### Here is an example capture of the homepage

Most of the links either link to google or to my Github. Enjoy!
